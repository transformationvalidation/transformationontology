<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This is the ontology that supports transformation and validation processes of datasets available in some data catalogues. The ontology can be used to guide the automation of a workflow that enables anyone to run transformations, validations and possibly data update management processes. The ontology re-uses existing W3C Web recommendations such as DCAT and PROV-O.![image](ontology.png)</span>
