<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This is the ontology that supports transformation and validation processes of datasets available in data catalogues. The instances of the ontology are declarative descriptions used by a workflow engine. The workflow engine orchestrates tasks based on these declarative descriptions, aiming at transforming input datasets into the desired representation. The ontology extends existing W3C Web Recommendations such as DCAT and PROV.![image](ontology.png)</span>
